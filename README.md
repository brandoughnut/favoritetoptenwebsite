Review comments: Sinatha Chin and Halley Pham - Your website is very easy to navigate and is easy on the eyes. I like how you both added the youtube review into the carousel along with you pictures. All the links and buttons works as it should and your site runs well. Both of your top ten pages looks like it belongs on the same website. Great job!!
